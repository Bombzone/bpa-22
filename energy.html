            As a community you can reduce your carbon emissions by turning off lights when they are not needed,
            replacing halogen and CFL (fluorescent bulbs) with Leds, they are up to 90% more efficient and last much
            longer, which reduces waste.

            Another thing you can partake in is unplugging electronic devices when they are not in use, such devices use some
            amount of standby power, which does add up.

            When washing clothes use cold water, cold water reduces energy spent to heat water, and is just as effective for cleaning dishes with the
            right detergent.

            By keeping your home a few degrees cooler in the winter and a little warmer in the summer it will take less
            energy to heat and cool your home, and save you money in the process.

            If possible, use renewable energy, and purchase/use items that are rated to use less energy.
