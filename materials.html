            As a community you can cut back on your plastic emissions by using refillable water bottles or totally
            abandoning plastic water bottles entirely. Doing this will reduce the emissions used to make said plastic
            water bottles, and keep them from ending up in landfills.

            Reuse items and if they have no use to you they might to someone else, donate them or repurpose them, keep
            them out of the land fill.

            Instead of allowing your food waste to go into the landfill you can compost it, by doing this you can reduce
            the emissions it produces when it decomposes in the landfill.

            Try to buy used clothes rather than new ones that take energy and produce emissions when they are being
            produced.
